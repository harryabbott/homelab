Overseerr works and will trigger a search within radarr/sonarr

Sonarr/Radarr do search and pass onto qbittorrent
(Also search in prowlarr (incl flaresolvarr) seems to work, and schedules it for download with qbittorrent)

Qbittorrent can download.

Download is placed in the /mnt/data/media

Library isnt auto updated in plex, but if manually done the film does show updated - might work with overseerr

Film will play
