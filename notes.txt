TODO:
- Maintainarr (auto remove media thats large)
- Homepage (less crap than homarr)
- Swaparr (finds new DL if 0 seeders)
- Use kubedns not static IP. need to read up on svc
- get tdarr node config (currently integrated node config is ephemeral)
- Swaparr to help with DLs with 0 seeders
- Make pods share pvc (as tested with plex + tdarr)
    - Downloads torrents and media should be on one PVC. the path can be controlled on application level. 
        - Exclude config as noisy frequent config requests over network will kill speeds.
- Change Sonarr/Radarr DL client categories to movies/tv (from radarr/tv-sonarr), will need to update in the downloaders in each app?
- try use desktop pc as k8 node for faster transcoding (or pi? supports arm)

TODO when NAS:
- add nas as storage device so not using device path. (makes more agnostic and easier for multi node)
- Move plex out of k8s and onto NAS (easier to configure hardware transcoding and direct connect)

DONE:
- Tdarr to standardize media formatting
- Tautulli for plex stats (see if transcoding is used to know if plex pass is worth it)
- use internal tdarr node (envvar internalNode=true)
- Fix Homarr dash and make sure config is saving properly by restarting to see if changes are ephemeral
